# 🏃 Boston Marathon 2023  
## Bib Number and Performance  
#### Byeolha Kim

---

# 🧭 Overview

- **Bib number** might predict marathon finish time  
- **Research Questions**:  
  - Does lower bib number indicate faster finish time?  
  - Are gender-based differences statistically significant?
  
  - 📂 **Data Source**:  
  Boston Marathon 2023 results were sourced from the [Score Network](https://data.scorenetwork.org/running/boston_marathon_2023.html), which provides publicly available race data for research and analysis purposes.

# 📊 Data Cleaning & Summary

- Source: Official Boston Marathon 2023  
- Observations after cleaning: ~26,500  
- Cleaning Criteria:
  - Removed missing values
  - Filtered finish times between 1 and 10 hours

```{r setup, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

data <- read.csv("boston_marathon_2023_cleaned.csv")

data <- data %>%
  mutate(
    bib_number = as.numeric(as.character(bib_number)),
    finish_net_minutes = as.numeric(as.character(finish_net_minutes))
  ) %>%
  filter(
    !is.na(bib_number),
    !is.na(finish_net_minutes),
    finish_net_minutes > 60,
    finish_net_minutes < 600
  )

summary(select(data, bib_number, finish_net_minutes, gender))
```

# 🔍 Analysis 1: 📈 Bib Number vs Finish Time

<div style="font-size:75%">

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model <- lm(finish_net_minutes ~ bib_number, data = data)
summary(model)
```
---

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=5, fig.width=8, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
model <- lm(finish_net_minutes ~ bib_number, data = data)

ggplot(data, aes(x = bib_number, y = finish_net_minutes)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1, color = "#4682B4") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", color = "#004080", se = FALSE, linewidth = 1) +
  labs(title = "Bib Number vs Net Finish Time",
       x = "Bib Number", y = "Finish Time (minutes)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Interpretation:**  
There is a strong positive relationship between bib number and finish time.  
Higher bib numbers are associated with slower runners.

# 📌 OLS Results Summary

- **Regression Equation:**  
  **Finish Time** = 162.6 + 0.00373 × **Bib Number**

- **Interpretation:**  
  Every increase of 1,000 in bib numbers leads to an estimated increase of approximately **3.73 minutes** in finish time.

- **Adjusted R²:** **0.6116** (Strong explanatory power)  
- **Statistical Significance:** **p-value < 2e-16** (Highly significant)

# 📊 Average Finish Time by Age Group

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data, aes(x = age_group, y = finish_net_minutes)) +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "bar", fill = "#66a3ff") +
  labs(title = "Average Finish Time by Age Group",
       x = "Age Group", y = "Finish Time (minutes)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

<div style="font-size:90%">

## 📊 Interpretation: Finish Time by Age Group

- The bar chart shows a clear upward trend in average finish time across age groups.
- **Runners aged 18–39** had the fastest average time (~210–220 minutes).
- As age increases, **average finish time rises gradually**, especially after **age 60**.
- **Runners aged 75–79** take about **90 minutes longer** on average than those under 40.
- The **80+ group** shows the slowest average, nearing 300 minutes (5 hours).
- This pattern reflects natural physiological declines and highlights the importance of age-adjusted pacing and training.

# 📊 Analysis 2: 🎭 Gender Differences in Performance

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data, aes(x = gender, y = finish_net_minutes, fill = gender)) +
  geom_violin(trim = FALSE, alpha = 0.7) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("M" = "#0072B2", "W" = "#56B4E9")) +
  labs(title = "Finish Time Distribution by Gender",
       x = "Gender", y = "Finish Time (minutes)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Interpretation:**  
The violin plot shows that **female runners** tend to finish **~23.5 minutes slower** than male runners.  
This difference is clearly visible and consistent across the distribution.

## 📌 Statistical Analysis: Gender Differences

<div style="font-size:75%">

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=3, fig.width=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
t.test(finish_net_minutes ~ gender, data = data)
```

---
| Gender | Mean Finish Time (mins) | SD (mins) | N      |
|--------|-------------------------|-----------|--------|
| **M**  | 212.42                  | 43.65     | 15,151 |
| **W**  | 235.91                  | 40.14     | 11,415 |

- **T-statistic:** -45.481  
- **p-value:** < 2.2e-16 (**Highly significant**)  
- **95% CI of Mean Difference (M − W):** [-24.51, -22.48]

## 🔵 Bib Number vs Finish Time by Gender

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data, aes(x = bib_number, y = finish_net_minutes, color = gender)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.2) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Bib Number vs Finish Time by Gender",
       x = "Bib Number", y = "Finish Time (minutes)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

<div style="font-size:90%">

## 🔵 Interpretation: Bib Number vs Finish Time by Gender

- This scatterplot shows how finish time increases as **bib number** increases — separated by gender.
- Both male and female runners follow the **same positive trend**, but with **parallel separation**.
- **Women (W)** tend to have consistently **longer finish times** than **men (M)** at the same bib number.
- The bib assignment system seems consistent across genders — but actual performance differs.

## 🟢 Finish Time Density by Gender

```{r echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
ggplot(data, aes(x = finish_net_minutes, fill = gender)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(title = "Finish Time Density by Gender",
       x = "Finish Time (minutes)", y = "Density") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("M" = "#0072B2", "W" = "#56B4E9")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

<div style="font-size:90%">

## 🟢 Interpretation: Finish Time Density by Gender

- This density plot highlights the **distributional differences** in finish time by gender.
- Male runners (dark blue) have a **left-shifted** distribution — they tend to finish faster overall.
- Female runners (light blue) show a **wider and more right-skewed** distribution, with more runners finishing in 220–280 minutes.
- The overlap between curves is relatively small, indicating a **clear difference in central tendency and spread**.

---

# ✅ Conclusion & Implications

- **Bib numbers are a strong predictor of finish time** — each 1,000-point increase is associated with a ~3.7-minute slower result.
- **Gender-based performance gaps** are consistent across all visualizations:
  - Women finish on average **~23.5 minutes slower** than men (t-test p < 0.001).
  - Density plots and violin plots confirm broader distributional differences.
- **Age groups** show a steady increase in finish time — especially after 60, highlighting the impact of age on endurance performance.
- Even within the same bib-number range, **gender and age differences remain**, showing bib alone is not the full story.


## 📌 Implications

- 🎯 **For race organizers**: Current bib assignment policy is statistically justified and effectively sorts runners by performance.
- 🧠 **For runners**: Age- and gender-adjusted pacing may help set realistic goals.
- 🔍 **For analysts**: Public marathon data can reveal nuanced performance dynamics across multiple demographics.

# 💭 Final Thought

_If a number on your chest could predict your pace, how would you train differently?_
